**Installation:**
- [Download](https://github.com/psykana/dos2deck/releases/latest) latest release
- [Transfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfsSCMiZVf4) d3d11.dll to `.../Divinity Original Sin 2/DefEd/bin`

**Known issues:**
Short profile name may cause "(Y) Change Profile" text in the main menu to get a little bit off screen.
Since GUI files are the *only* ones that cannot be easily overriden by mods, I decided to leave it be.
